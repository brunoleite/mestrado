\begin{abstract}
There have been considerable efforts in the literature towards understanding and modeling dynamic aspects of 
scientific communities. Despite the great interest, little is known about the role that different members play 
in the formation of the underlying network structure of such comminities. In this paper, we provide a wide 
investigation of the roles that members of the core of scientific communities play in the collaboration network 
structure formation and evolution. To do that, we define a community core based an individual metric, 
\it{core score}, which is an h-index derived measure that captures both, the prolifcness and the involvement
of researchers in a community. Our results provide a number of key observations related to community formation and 
evolving patterns. Particularly, we show that members of the core community work as bridges that connect smaller 
clustered research groups. Furthermore, members of a scientific community core are responsible for an increase in 
the average degree of the whole community undrelying network and a decrease on the overall network assortativeness. 
More important, we note that variations on the members of the community core tend to be strongly correlated with 
variations on these metrics. We argue that our observations are important for shedding a light on the role of key 
members on community formation and structure.
