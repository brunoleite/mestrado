\section{Defining Community Core}

\subsection{Quantifying authors involvement}
% {\bf Desirable:\\
%      \sout{-Rank better prolific authors (h-index)} \\
%      \sout{-Frequent involvement (numero de papers}) \\
%      \sout{-Recent involvement (janela temporal)}}\\\\
In the academic community, the researchers are always seeking to contribute for yours areas, such contributions occurs
through publications, it is importants a mechanism to measures the impact of a researchers inside of the community. 
For this, there is a measures called of h-index \cite{Hirsch:2005}, the h-index is based on the number of publications 
and its references to a particular author has. This measure is widely accepted by the academic community.\\
The h-index is a metric created to measure how prolific a researcher is, but it alone is not sufficient to quantify
the importance of a researcher in a particular community, as a conference. To measure the impact of a
researcher in a conference, we must consider your contributions to the community in general, in this case, h-index, 
and your contributions to a specific community.
It is important consider the contributions to a specific community, because two researcher can have the same h-index. That
does not mean that both have the same importance for the conference, because one can have more publications at a conference 
the other. We define the number of publications of a researcher in a given conference as the measure that quantifies 
their involvement in a given communities.\\
Here, we have two measure, the h-index measure the researcher importance in the academic community and the number of 
publications that measure the importance of a researcher in a specific community. But without a temporal information,
it is only possible define how importante the researcher was to the entire community, because we should use the data 
accumulated over the years. So, we need aggregate the temporal information in our measure, we need consider the number 
of publications of a researcher in a given time \textit{t}.\\
After these definitions, it is possible to determine a measure to rank the researcher according to their importance
to a community at a given time, where the can be a temporal window. We define this measure as core score and can be see
in the Equation \ref{eq:core_score}.
\begin{equation} 
  \label{eq:core_score}
  Core{ }Score[a] = h\textrm{-}index[a] * number\textrm{ }of\textrm{ }publication[a,t]
\end{equation}
where \textit{h-index[a]} represents the h-index of a given author and the \textit{number of publication[a,t]} represents 
the number of publications of a given author in a given time.

% The core score measures the author's importance of a given conference. The core score uses the publication number 
% of an author in a conference in the time \textit{t} and their h-index \cite{Hirsch:2005}. The h-index, defined 
% as the number of papers with citations number higher or equal to \textit{h}, it is a useful index to characterize 
% the scientific output of a researcher. The core score is defined as:
% \begin{equation}Core Score = h\textrm{-}index * number\textrm{ }of\textrm{ }publication[t]\end{equation}
% where h-index is computed using the data of shine and the number of publication in the time \textit{t} is computed 
% using the data of DBLP\cite{Ley:2009}.

\subsection{Inferring authors h-index}
% {\bf-Por que nao google citations ou MS? \\
%      -Shine \\
%      -Correlacao com h-index do google}\\\\
As explained in the previous section, the h-index is measure accepts by the academic communities. The values of h-index 
can be found out in many tools of academic area as Google Scholar Citations\footnote{http://scholar.google.com/citations}, 
Microsoft Academic Search\footnote{http://academic.research.microsoft.com/} and others.\\
The h-index allows determine how prolific a researcher is, thus this information is a important point for this work.
At first we tried to use the data from Google Scholar Citations, but we had basically two problems which hampered this.
This tool does not have a API to crawl the data, so this make the work hard, but what did we change
the direction to use this data, it is because not all researchers have a profile. Despite the Google Scholar Citations 
has values acceptable to h-index in the academic community, for it to calculate the researchers' h-index, they need create 
a profile providing personal data. In our crawl, it only found out 30\% of researcher of DBLP in Google Scholar Citations,
thus one amount as low could bias this work.\\
We also try to use the Microsoft Academic Search, that differently of Google Scholar Citations, it creates the researcher 
profile automatically, but it has lower values of h-index. The Microsoft Academic Search has an API to crawl the data, 
but this API is basead on publications, which also hinders the crawl of researcher. When we send a query to the API, 
based in researcher name, the API return all publications that have that researcher as author. It is possible change 
the return to authors, but in this case, the API return all researchers that have at least one publication along 
with the researcher name entered.\\
Since the limitation of these tools, we decided to perform the calculation of the h-index using data from the 
SHINE project\footnote{http://shine.icomp.ufam.edu.br/}. The project collected many publications along with their 
references, they used this data to infer the h-index of academics conferences, as shown in the Table \ref{tab:sigs_conference_period}.
They collected the main conferences of each area of academic ... {\bf falar mais do shine}.\\
We crossed the data from the SHINE with DBLP and after this we have a number of citations of each publication, so we calculated
the h-index of each researcher. To validate this calcule, we selected, randomly, 10 researcher of each conference into Table
\ref{tab:sigs_conference_period} and crawled your profile in Google Scholar Citations. We obtain a value of 0.85 of 
pearson coefficient which indicates a strongly positive correlation, as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:hindex_scatter_plot}.

\subsection{Setting core size and time thresholds}
This work has a temporal focus, so to represent this issue we are using temporal sliding windows over the years. Several
experiments were performed varying the window size. Initially we varied the size between 1 and 5 years, but along with the
classic social network metrics and size variation of the Core Community, we would have many experiments in the study.
So, we need to determine two values, the size of the sliding window and the size of the core community.\\
To determine the size of the temporal window we calculate measure resemblance defined in \cite{Viswanath:2009} for all conferences.
We vary the values of the size window, between 1 and 5 years, and the size of core community, between
10\% and 60\%, so we plot the data where the x-axis represents the variation in the size of windows and the y-axis represents
the average values of resemblance, each line the variation of the size of the core community. The 
Figure \ref{fig:averange_values_resemblance} showns the behavior of the curves of conferences SIGMOD and SIGDOC. Again, due to lack 
of space, we are showing only this conferences, we choose them because they are the conferences with the highest h-index 
and the lowest, consecutively.
\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \begin{center}
    \subfigure[SIGMOD]{%
      \label{fig:sigmod_slide_window_top_list}
      \includegraphics[scale=.33]{graficos/window_core_size/sigmod_slide_window_top_list.eps}
    }%
    \subfigure[SIGDOC]{%
      \label{fig:sigdoc_slide_window_top_list}
      \includegraphics[scale=.33]{graficos/window_core_size/sigdoc_slide_window_top_list.eps}
    }%
  \end{center}
\caption{Average of the values of resemblance}
 \label{fig:averange_values_resemblance}
\end{figure}
How we can see in the Figure \ref{fig:averange_values_resemblance}, the behavior of the curves are similar, so we use the
angular coefficient to calculate the slope of the curves and after we compute the average of the value. The window size
3 is, in most cases, where the curve stabilizes, so it is the value adopted in this work. As for the size of Core 
Community, we adopted the value of 10\%, for the other experiments, due the proximity of the curves.

\subsection{Validations}
The measure defined as Core Score is important to shows the impact of the research in given community. We chosen two importants 
researchers to exemplify the use of the meausre. In the Figure \ref{fig:cc_kleinberg} is showns the impact of Jon Kleinberg in
conferences which he published. It is possible to see that he becomes relevant even in conferences that he is not part of
Core Community, because he is always ranked well. Similarly, we can see in the Figure \ref{fig:cc_luis_von_ahn} the impact
of Luis von Ahn, another important researcher in his area. This researcher is different from Jon Kleinberg, because he has a
considerable impact, however, he become part of Core Community only a conference and a short period, getting close to the Core
Community in subsequent periods. Importantly, we are showing only the conferences listed in Table \ref{tab:sigs_conference_period}.\\

\caption{Ranking using Core Score}
 \label{fig:rank_core_score_authors}
\end{figure}
This way, we showed the impact of the two research in the conferences, but who are the researchers who appear most often in the
Core Community of each communities, or in this case, conferences? In the Table \ref{tab:authors_frequency_core_community} is 
shown that main confereces linked the web area, it is possible to see the researchers known by the academic community.
