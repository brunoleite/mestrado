\section{Defining a Community Core}

Previous attempts for identifying the community core of a scientific community are based on algorithmic approaches that aim at identifying dense clusters of nodes in the
network~\cite{Seifi:2012:CCE:2187980.2188258}.  However, as we plan to investigate the role of a core in the network structure, any approach that makes use of the network structure
to identify such nodes could lead us to a biased set of authors. Instead, we focus on developing a metric that quantifies the involvement of a researcher in a scientific community
during a certain period of time.  Intuitively, this metric should be able to capture (i) the prolificness of an author in different communities and (ii) the frequency of involvement
of that author with the community in a certain period of time.

First, in order to capture the prolificness of an author, we use the h-index~\cite{Hirsch:2005}, a metric widely adopted for this purpose. This metric consists of an index that attempts to measure both
the productivity and the impact of the published work of a researcher. It is based on the set of the researcher's most cited papers and the number of citations that they have received.
More specifically, a researcher $a$ has an h-index $h_a$ if she has published h papers which have received at least h citations. Thus, for example, if an author has 10 papers with at least 10 citations, her h-index is 10.  
%More specifically, a researcher $a$ has an h-index $h_a$ if $h$ of her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other (N âˆ’ h) papers have no more than h citations each. Thus,
if an author have 10 papers with at least 10 citations, she has h-index 10.  

Second, as an attempt to capture the importance of an author to a specific community in a certain period of time, we multiple her h-index by the number of publications this author
has in a certain community during a time window. We name this measure \textit{Core Score}. More formally, the Core Score of an author $a$ in a community $c$ during a period of
time $t$, $Core{ }Score_{a,c,t}$, is given by its $h\textrm{-}index_a$ multiplied by the number of publications $a$ has in $c$ during $t$ ($\textrm{\#}publications_{a,c,t}$),
as expressed by Equation~\ref{eq:core_score}. 

\begin{equation} 
  \label{eq:core_score}
  Core{ }Score_{a,c,t} = h\textrm{-}index_a \times \textrm{\#}publications_{a,c,t}
\end{equation}

%\begin{equation} 
%  \label{eq:core_score}
%  Core{ }Score_{a,c,t} = h\textrm{-}index_a \times number\textrm{ }of\textrm{ }publications_{a,c,t}
%\end{equation}

We note that the first part of the equation captures the importance of an author to the scientific community as whole regardless any specific research area or period of time and the second part weights this
importance based on the activity of the author in a certain community and time.  By computing the core score for the members of a community, we define the community core in a
certain period of time as the top researchers of that community in terms of their core scores in the given period. Next, in Section~\ref{sub:hindex}, we detail how we inferred the h-index of authors. 
Then, Section~\ref{sub:thresholds} discusses how we define two important thresholds: the size of the community core and the time window used in our analyses.


\subsection{Inferring Authors' H-index}
\label{sub:hindex}

There are multiple tools that measure the h-index of research authors, out of which Google Scholar\footnote{http://scholar.google.com/citations} is the most prominent one.
However, to have a profile in this system, a researcher needs to sign up and explicitly create her research profile.  In a preliminary collection of part of the profiles of
the DBLP authors, we found that less than 30\% of these authors had a profile in the Google citations. Thus, this strategy would reduce our dataset and
potentially introduce bias when analyzing the communities.
 
To divert from this limitation, we used data from SHINE, the Simple HINdex Estimation project\footnote{http://shine.icomp.ufam.edu.br/}, to infer the authors' h-index.
SHINE provides a website that allows users to check the h-index of almost two thousands computer science conferences. They crawled Google Scholar, searching for the title of papers
published in a number of conferences, which allowed them to effectively estimate the h-index of these target conferences based on the citations computed by Google Scholar. Although
SHINE only allows one to search for the h-index of a conference, the SHINE developers kindly allowed us to access their database to infer the h-index of authors based on the
conferences they crawled.

\caption{Correlation between the inferred h-index and Google Scholar one}
\label{fig:hindex_scatter_plot}
\end{figure}


However, there is one important limitation with this strategy.  As SHINE does not track all the existent computer science conferences, authors' h-index might be underestimated when computed
with this data. To investigate this issue, we compared the h-index of a set of authors with a profile on Google Scholar with their estimated h-index based on the SHINE data. For this, we
randomly selected 10 researchers for each conference from Table~\ref{tab:sigs_conference_period} and extracted their h-indexes from their Google Scholar profiles.  In comparison
with the h-index we estimated from SHINE, the Google scholar values are, on average, 50\% higher. Figure~\ref{fig:hindex_scatter_plot} shows the scatter plot for the two h-index
measures. We can note that although SHINE h-index is smaller, the two measures are highly correlated. The pearson correlation coefficient is 0.85, which indicates that authors
might have proportional h-index estimations in both systems. 

\subsection{Setting the Thresholds}
\label{sub:thresholds}


There are two important thresholds in our approach we need to define to determine the core of a scientific community.  The first is related to the time window in which the core
community is computed. In other words, should we compute the community core at each year, at each two years, or for a larger time window? The second threshold is related to the
size of the community core. As we define the core of a community as the top researchers in terms of their core score during a certain time window, it is important to define the
threshold for choosing the top ones.

Our strategy to define these two thresholds consists of varying each of them and quantifying how they impact on the changes on the members of the community core. To measure these
changes, we compute the resemblance metric, as used in~\cite{Viswanath:2009}, which measures the fraction of members in the core at time $t_0$ that remains in the core at the
time $t_1$. For each community, we varied the window size from 1 to 5 years and the size of the community core from 10\% to 60\% of the entire community.

Intuitively, high resemblance variations indicate bad threshold choices and, thus, we should seek for values in which threshold changes cause slight changes on resemblance.
Figure~\ref{fig:averange_values_resemblance} shows the resemblance values as a function of the window size, providing different curves for the community core size.  We chose the
SIGMOD and CHI communities for this analysis. The rest of the communities are omitted due to lack of space, but the same observations hold for them. By visual inspection we would set the core
size as 10\% due to the proximity of the curves, and the window size as 2 or 3, as most of the communities showed a more stable resemblance after these values. To help us decide, we
computed the angular coefficient for the 10\% core size curves of each community and obtained the average angular coefficient for them.  Based on this value, we chose the window
size for our experiments as 3.

\caption{Average of the values of resemblance}
 \label{fig:averange_values_resemblance}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Validation}

Based on the core score value, we expect that the members of the community core would be standing researchers that actively contribute with publications to a certain community.
The validation of this assumption is, by nature, subjective.  Thus, we provide next evidence that our approach correctly captures this expected characteristic.

First, we analyzed the core score of two WWW 2013 keynote speakers: Jon Kleinberg and Luis von Ahn.  Figure~\ref{fig:rank_core_score_authors} shows the ranking position in terms of
percentage (i.e., position 5\% of that community) of these two authors in the communities they have published. The botton line divides the members of the community core from the others.
We can note that Jon Kleinberg was a member of the community core of STOC, a theoretical conference, for years. Indeed, he was part of the STOC core for twelve years,
publishing seven STOC papers in a single period of three years. With Kleinberg's involvement on KDD, he became less active in STOC and left the core of that community for some time.
During this period, he published several KDD papers, while his STOC publications were drastically reduced.  When it comes to Luis von Ahn, we can note that he is more active in
the CHI community, a community in which he published six papers along his academic life. He reached the core of the CHI community along three consecutive time windows,
publishing four CHI papers in a single period.

  \end{center}
\caption{Core score of two WWW 2013 keynote speakers}
 \label{fig:rank_core_score_authors}
\end{figure}


Next, we computed a ranking of researchers that appear most often in the community core of each scientific community. We chose the KDD, SIGCOMM, SIGIR, and SIGMOD communities to show their
top 20 researchers in Table~\ref{tab:authors_frequency_core_community}.
As we can note, several big names appear in this top list, including past keynote speakers of these conferences
as well as awarded authors by their life time contributions in that community. Indeed, by analyzing the awarded researchers 
from each community we found that a large fraction of them appeared in the community core at least one time in the conference history. More specifically, these fractions 
are 75\% of the awarded KDD\footnote{http://www.sigkdd.org/awards\_innovation.php} members, 35\% for SIGCOMM\footnote{http://www.sigcomm.org/awards/sigcomm-awards}, 
60\% for SIGIR\footnote{http://www.sigir.org/awards/awards.html}, and 80\% for SIGMOD\footnote{http://www.sigmod.org/sigmod-awards}. These observations 
provide evidence that our approach correctly captures the notion of a scientific community core.
